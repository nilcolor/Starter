What da-hell is this?
=====================

This is my [Pyramid][pyramid] playground.  
Here I make some expiriments with Pyramid. Learn how thing are build. How to live
with [traversal][1]. How to use MongoDB here and how to craft JSON response here...
So -- it _is_ playground.  
You can read it ofcourse, if you wish...

What's here right now?
----------------------

- Very simple resource tree (check resources.py).  
- More than useless two view callables which responds to `GET:/foo/bar` and `POST:/foo/bar`

Thats all for now. Infant, yeah...

What's next?
------------

- Security based on resource tree
- some real DB works
